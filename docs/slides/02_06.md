# Special Classes

> >

There are some totally unique classes to Tailwind CSS, let's take a look at what they do.

# Divide

- `divide(-DIR)(-AMT)`
  - **SID**<br>
    `x` `y`
  - **AMT** (divide)<br>
    `0` `2` `4` `8` `reverse`
- `divide-COL-STR/OPA` `divide-(STL)`
  - **STL** (divide-style)<br>
    `none` `solid` `dashed` `dotted` `double`

You can set the direction or the width of the lines that will appear between elements and Tailwind will automatically add the borders in between the elements. Although there is no single pixel border, if you simply use `divide-x` or `divide-y` without an amount, you'll get one pixel.

You may also need some classes like `inline-block` or a span tag for divides that run in the x order.

There's an interesting additional reverse option here. If you're using flexbox to reverse the position of the elements, this extra class will make sure that the borders appear in the right place with something like `divide-y-reverse flex flex-col-reverse`

# Ring

- `ring(-AMT)`
  - `0` `1` `2` `4` `8` `inset`
- `ring-COL-STR/OPA`
- `ring-offset-WDT`
  - `0` `1` `2` `4` `8`
    `ring-offset-COL-STR`

The ring class is like the border class, but a bit more flexible.
