Tailwind CSS burst onto the Full Stack Developer scene with a fundamentally different new approach called Utility First.

Instead of defining classes that fully describe elements ...like buttons or navigation, it focuses on utilities that define styles directly like margin, padding, colors and borders.

What seems like a counterinuitive approach at first, gives you freedom to define your layouts directly into components.

What makes Tailwind CSS special is the large number of modifier and customizations that allows you to control how styles change at media query breakpoints, pseudo elements, attributes and even through user settings like dark mode.

This makes Tailwind CSS the best way to work with CSS in module based frameworks like React, Vue, Angular and Svelte.
