Tailwind CSS has a plugin system that allows you to extend how it works. There's some built in plugins as well, let's take a look.

# Plugins

- Added in Config
- Full JavaScript
- Adds classes

> >

To create or add a plugin, you add code to your config file. This is something that you can try out with either the build tool or the playground.

Plugins give you full javascript control over how Tailwind CSS works.

It can go beyond the config file by giving you a way to create and modify classes dynamically.

# Sample Plugin

```js
const plugin = require('tailwindcss/plugin')

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    plugin(function ({ addUtilities }) {
      addUtilities({
        '.huge': { 'font-size': '10em' }
      })
    })
  ]
}
```

Here's what a basic plugin looks like.

It receives a single object, that can be destructured into individual variables with different tasks.

The different parameters do different things. For example, you can use `addUtilities` to register new utility classes. Unlike other classes though, these won't let people use custom sizes.

Honestly, with the new Just In Time compiler, I'm not sure this is the best way to add classes to the framework, specially custom classes.

The JavaScript angle is a bit more interesting, specially if you're used to doing CSS in JavaScript.
