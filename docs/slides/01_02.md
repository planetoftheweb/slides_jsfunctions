# Installation

There are way too many ways to install Tailwind CSS and cover them all. I'm going to go through a basic installation with the CLI, so you can get a feel for how it works.

---

# Start

```bash
cd ~/Desktop
npm init vite tailwindcss3
cd tailwindcss3
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

To do this, we're going to use a terminal application. You can use the terminal from Mac OS, or the Terminal tool called GitBash that you can install when you add Git to your machine.

To get started we can run the npm init vite command. This will create a project with a vite template and ask you a series of questions.

Next we'll cd to the directory we created.

Next we'll do some additional installations. You can install any other modules you need, but we'll need at least postcss, tailwind and autoprefixer. Tailwind runs as a PostCSS Plugin and autoprefixer adds any prefix to make Tailwind be more compatible with some older browsers.

You also need a couple of config files. A `tailwind.config.js` as well as a `postcss.config.js`.

Now we're ready to open this with our editor. I'll be using Visual Studio Code.

In order to use tailwind, you need to have a css file that builds the styles from a series of modules.

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

Now, open the `tailwind.config.js` file.

```json
  content: [
    "./index.html",
    "./src/**/*.{vue,js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
  ],
```

In the content section we can define the name of the files we want Tailwind to look at.

```js
// tailwind.config.js

module.exports = {
  content: ['./src/index.html', './src/**/*.{vue,js,ts,jsx,tsx}'],
  theme: {
    extend: {}
  },
  plugins: []
}
```

Let's update the tailwind.config file so that it's pointing to the proper place.

```js
//vite.config.js

export default {
  root: 'src',
  publicDir: 'public',
  outDir: '../docs',
  server: {
    open: true
  }
}
```

One thing that drives me nuts is when everything is just in the root directory, so i'm going to configure Vite to use the source directory.

```html
<div class="max-w-4xl px-5 mx-auto">
  <h1 class="text-7xl font-bold text-purple-900">Headline</h1>
  <p>
    Lorem ipsum, dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Suscipit at rem numquam. Culpa sit possimus suscipit in debitis consectetur minima eum
    quia veritatis quos omnis ex, quas accusamus natus dolorum.
  </p>
</div>
```

Now, let's add some super simple HTML and some basic tailwind classes. Don't worry if these don't make too much sense right now.
