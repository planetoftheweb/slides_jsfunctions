# Tailwind Colors

> >

Tailwind CSS has the richest color palette of any framework I've ever seen. That's because it doesn't need to worry about publishing the CSS for this...The Just in Time compiler saves only what you need.

# Color Classes

- Background (bg-COL-STR)
- Text (text-COL-STR)
- Lots more

You'll see the color palette affect all types of classes including the main ones, the background classes as well as the text classes.

There's too many to list, there are colors for rings, divides, borders, carets, accents, etc. but they all work the same way.

The colors are defined with different strength levels from 50 to 900.

# Background Image

- `bg(-none)|(-gradient-to)(-DIR)`
  - **DIR**<br>
    `t` `tr` `r` `br` `b` `bl` `l` `tl`

Although there's a set of classes referred to in the docs as the background image classes, you can't really use images. It's meant to let you use the `background-image` css property to insert a set of gradients.

To use it you specify either bg-none for no background or bg-gradient-to and then a direction. The direction are the typical top right bottom left with the additional corners in one of two letter directions.

These classes don't make sense without a gradient stop. It's a separate set of classes we'll explore next, but I've included one in the sample so you can see it in action.

# Gradient Color Stops

- `(from|via|to)-COL-AMT`

To create gradient color steps, you simply use one of three keywords from, via and to to specify a breakpoint for your gradients.

You are still going to need to specify a direction with a background image class.

If you only specify a `from` color stop it will go to white. If you also specify `to` then the gradient will start `from` one color and go `to` the ending color. Remember that the direction might be set right to left, so the gradient can look like it's going backwards.

With the `via` keyword you add a middle point for the gradient. You cannot add more than one mid point.
