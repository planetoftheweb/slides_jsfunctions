There are a couple of modifiers that let you control how elements behave when users have modified certain operating system settings.

Users can choose to turn on a reduced animation setting and this lets you control how your page deals with that setting.

`motion-reduce` lets you modify the behavior when users choosed that setting.

`motion safe` lets you specify what to do when this setting is off. This is the default, but it might help when designing behaviors.

# Other Media

- `portrait`
- `landscape`
- `print`

These modifiers let you control how things work on certain devices.

Mobile devices often allow you change their orientation from portrait to landscape, so there are two modifiers that let you control that.

The print modifier lets you control how elements appear when printing.
