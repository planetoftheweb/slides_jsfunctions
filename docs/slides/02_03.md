Tailwind is really innovative but we need to take a look at some of the issues you might run into when working with the framework and what to do about it.

# Tailwind Pitfalls

- Build process
- A lot of classes
- Repeated Elements
- Impossible to memorize

We've mentioned some of these before, but let's go over them a bit. First is that unlike frameworks like Bootstrap where you simple add a link tag to a css file Tailwind really requires a build process. We already looked at the different ways

Also, it takes a lot of classes to even do simple designs. Now there is a way around this, but it's one of the things that shocks people when they first run into the framework.

When you have to use elemets over an over, it is a nightmare to update all of the copies of the classes. Let's say that I was doing a bunch of buttons on a page and then changed something about the buttons. If I was just using the classes, then i'd have to find all of the instances and update them.

The design system uses a set of units that can sometimes be confusing. The framework has a crazy amount of classes. Don't try to memorize them. This is one framework that will work well as long as your're ready to pull up the docs. I also think the documentation's classes are sort of spread out in different places. Buttons, for example share some of the same focus ring classes as input fields, so there isn't a place to find all of the classes to do a proper button.

# Versus Inline Styles

- Design system
- Reponsive utilities
- State Variants

You might be thinking that using these classes is pretty close to using the style attribute in HTML, so why wouldn't you use that instead.

Well, one of the reasons is that by limiting the amount of classes you have to use, you establish a design system that uses classes with related units. Just in case you're wondering, you can still use custom sizes within the framework.

There's a couple of things that you can do with Tailwind CSS that you can't do with inline styles. There are a number of responsive utilities that allow you to define how styles are applied at different breakpoints.

In a similar way, you can also uses a number of state variants that allow you to control how Tailwind CSS behaves during certain states like a hover or a focus.
