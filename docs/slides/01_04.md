Tailwind CSS has a special CDN or content delievery version of the framework that you can use for demos or to try features of the platform.

# CDN

```html
<script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
```

Notice that this isn't a stylesheet, but a special JavaScript file hosted on a Content Delivery Network. The JavaScript file does something similar to what the build process does.

It analyzes the file that calls it and looks for places with Tailwinds CSS code. It then dynamically creates styles based on that assessment using javascript.

This lets you create your own demos on sites like CodePen or using plugins like CodeSwing.
