# Existing Scales

Tailwind CSS has some existing scales used throughout different classes that it uses when building or customizing elements.

# Scales

- spacing, colors, screens, etc.

```js
padding: ({ theme }) => theme('spacing')
```

```js
ringColor: ({ theme }) => ({
  DEFAULT: theme('colors.blue.500', '#3b82f6'),
  ...theme('colors')
})
```

There are some scales that are used throughout the themes, to simplify the creation or repeating elements.

They might be useful when customizing elements or creating new ones.

If we want to use an existing scale, we can recursively reference the theme like in the padding definition.

You can also use the spread operator when you want to add the scale to an existing class.

You can learn a lot from using the config file. There's additional instructions in the documentation for how to do things. Some, but not all of these can be done with the play CDN.
