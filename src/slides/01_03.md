You've already seen the basic way to declare a function, but there's another way that's pretty common called a Definition Expressions.

# Declaration/Invocation

```js [3-6|8]
const $ = document.querySelector.bind(document)

function add(a, b) {
  const c = a + b;
  return c;
}

const output = add(2, 2)

$('#output').innerHTML = output
console.log(output)
```

This is what we did in the last video, it's the classic declaration/invocation pattern. 

Because we're using a return statement, we can use an assignment

# Standalone Invocation

```js [3-6|5-6]
const $ = document.querySelector.bind(document)

function add(a, b) {
  const c = a + b;
  $('#output').innerHTML = c
  console.log(c)
}

add(2, 2)
```

It's not necessary to make an assignment in order to call a function. So here, we added the output directly inside the function.

What lets you do the assignment is the return statement we saw earlier.

In this case, we're not using the return statement so we can simply output things directly.

Notice that the

# Declaration/Invocation

```
function add(a, b) {
  const c = a + b;
  return c;
}

const output = add(2, 2)
```


- When we place the statements inside the curly braces, we're declaring the function.
