# Using the Exercises

> >

Tailwind is not something for beginners. You need to be comfortable with build tools and configuration. I'm going to walk you in the next chapter's movies through a build process you can use.

There's a few videos that require this more complicated build process. You can get to the at through GitHub

However, it's also something that you can use one or more playgrounds to try, so I'll also show you how to set these up yourself and you'll see that the course, I'll have plenty of links for you to try things out and play with it.

The best way to get the code and all of the links is through the [slideshow I've prepared for you](https://raybo.org/slides_tailwind3).

At the bottom of the slideshow you'l find a navigation toolbar. You can hit the t key to show or hide the toolbar.

If you hit the m key, you'll see an index of all of the slides for the course. If you click on a slide that slide will play on your monitor.

At the beginning of each slide, there is an overlay with a link to each of the slides. If you're watching the video, you can jump to each of the slides at that URL.

To move through the slides you can use the arrow keys.

The slides are fully interactive, so you can click on buttons or copy any code you see on screen.

If you click inside a text area and get stuck inside an editable item, just double click towards the top of the slides.

You also have access to a micro site with all of my notes for this course, Just open up the slide index by hitting the m key and then click on notes.

You can navigate to each of my notes on the left navigation and on the right go through each of the sections on slides.

If you want to go back to slide view click on the icon to the right of the index.

A lof of the slides have links to Codepen demos where you can follow along with me, copy the code or try it yourself.

Letâ€™s get started.
