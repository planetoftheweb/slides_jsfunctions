# Attribute Modifiers

> >

There's a couple of ways to target certain modifiers that allow you to change the way that Tailwind CSS works with certain attributes.

# RTL Support

- `dir="DIR"`
  - `rtl`
  - `ltr`

There is an important attribute that you can use with HTML that sets your page up to support both ritht to left typography as well as left to right.

You can use this dir property, which normally goes in the HTML tag to set this up.

Tailwind has two modifiers that let you define how your code will react to this setting.

You can include an `rtl` modifier or an `ltr` modifier.

The page library will have a ltr orientation by default, so if you only need to support one direction, you don't need to use these modifiers.

# Open/Close State

- `open`

There is an `open` modifer that you can use to control what happens with certain HTML element types like the `<details>` or the `<dialog>` tags.
