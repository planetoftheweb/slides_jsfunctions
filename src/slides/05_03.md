# Line Clamp

There is another cool plugin that will help you truncate your content after a fixed number of lines.

# Line Clamp Plugin

**Installing**

```bash
npm install -D @tailwindcss/line-clamp
```

**Config**

```js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [require('@tailwindcss/line-clamp')]
}
```

Just like with the prose plugin, you have to install this using NPM in your build process and then modify your plugins in the config file.

# The Class

- `line-clamp-QTY`
  - QTY: `none` `1` `2` `3` `4` `5` `6`

> >

This one is much simpler, but still quite useful.

You get a line-clamp class with the number of lines you want to cut off the text at.
