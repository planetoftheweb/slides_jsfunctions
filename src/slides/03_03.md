Another one of the powerful modifiers allow you to control what happens when a child element or a sibling element is activated.

# Child Modifiers

- `group`
- `group-*`

`group`
Set up a group to control items that you want to modify together.
​
`group-*`
Modify any pseudo class like group-focus, group-active or group-odd as long as there's a parent group modifier.

# Sybling Modifiers

- `peer`
- `peer-*`

`peer`
Similarly to group, peer modifier sets up the items that are available to be controlled as peers, so place that in a sibling element.
​
`peer-*`
Then you can use the peer-\* modifiers to control the peers. This works with every peer modifier.

One thing to watch out is that you can only do this with previous siblings. not with siblings that are established afterwards.
