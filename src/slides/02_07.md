Tailwind CSS has a set of responsive modifiers that allow you to target what happens to your styles at certain breakpoints.

This feature works with every utility class in the framework and also with custom sizes. It's one of the things that makes the framework so powerful.

- Every utility class
- Mobile first

This affects every utility class in the framework.

This is a mobile first approach, so the classes will affect the current breakpoint and any breakpoints above that.

That means that if you want to target a specific breakpoint or a range of breakpoints, you'll need to create breakpoints before and/or after to establish a range.
